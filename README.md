# Loss-to-follow-up-in-patients-with-neovascular-age-related-macular-degeneration-and-diabetic-retinop
Specific Aims:

1. To determine the percentage of patients lost to follow up at 1 year for patients initiating Anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular age related macular degeneration
2. To determine the percentage of patients lost to follow up at 1 year for patients treated for diabetic retinopathy.  For this subgroup, I would like to examine those treated with panretinal photocouagulation, anti-VEGF therapy or combination of the two.

For both groups, we would like to examine demographic factors such as Age, Gender, Race, Visual Acuity, Insurance Type, Income, and Distance to Clinic to further identify risk factors for loss to follow up.  A previous publication from a single site revealed that Age, Race, and Income were risk factors for loss to follow up.

Study Date Range (data available from 1/1/2013-12/31/2018):  

1.	Look at patients newly diagnosed with neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration from 1/1/2013 through 12/31/2015; and see how many are followed up 1, 2, and 3 years post diagnosis
2.	Look at patients newly diagnosed with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy from 1/1/2013 through 12/31/2015; and see how many are followed up 1, 2, and 3 years post diagnosis

Study Population Age Range: Not relevant

Inclusion Criteria/Index Event: (include all ICD 9 and ICD 10 and CPT codes that are relevant) 

H35.32 (exudative AMD) and Intravitreal Injections of Avastin, Lucentis or Eylea that were first treated in the above time period
E11.351, E311.355 and E11.359 and treated with PRP, Anti-VEGF or Combination in the time period described earlier
Exclusion Criteria: (include all ICD 9 and ICD 10 and CPT codes that are relevant)
Diagnosis of H35.32 before this period
Diagnosis of E11.351, E11.355 or E11.359 before this period

Primary outcomes of interest: Loss to Follow up at 1, 2 and 3 years for each of the conditions

Secondary outcomes of interest: Demographic factors such as Age, Gender, Race, Visual Acuity, Insurance Type, Income, and Distance to Clinic to further identify risk factors for loss to follow up.  A previous publication from a single site revealed that Age, Race, and Income were risk factors for loss to follow up.
